MCP servers start automatically when the plugin is enabled.

## Installation

```bash
claude /plugin install compound-engineering
```

## Known Issues

### MCP Servers Not Auto-Loading

**Issue:** The bundled MCP servers (Playwright and Context7) may not load automatically when the plugin is installed.

**Workaround:** Manually add them to your project's `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@playwright/mcp@latest"],
      "env": {}
    },
    "context7": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.context7.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Or add them globally in `~/.claude/settings.json` for all projects.
