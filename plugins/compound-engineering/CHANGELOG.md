# Changelog

All notable changes to the compound-engineering plugin will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.34.0] - 2026-02-14

### Added

- **Gemini CLI target** — New converter target for [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli). Install with `--to gemini` to convert agents to `.gemini/skills/*/SKILL.md`, commands to `.gemini/commands/*.toml` (TOML format with `description` + `prompt`), and MCP servers to `.gemini/settings.json`. Skills pass through unchanged (identical SKILL.md standard). Namespaced commands create directory structure (`workflows:plan` → `commands/workflows/plan.toml`). 29 new tests. ([#190](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin/pull/190))

---

## [2.33.1] - 2026-02-13

### Changed

- **`/workflows:plan` command** - All plan templates now include `status: active` in YAML frontmatter. Plans are created with `status: active` and marked `status: completed` when work finishes.
- **`/workflows:work` command** - Phase 4 now updates plan frontmatter from `status: active` to `status: completed` after shipping. Agents can grep for status to distinguish current vs historical plans.

---

## [2.33.0] - 2026-02-12

### Added

- **`setup` skill** — Interactive configurator for review agents
  - Auto-detects project type (Rails, Python, TypeScript, etc.)
  - Two paths: "Auto-configure" (one click) or "Customize" (pick stack, focus areas, depth)
  - Writes `compound-engineering.local.md` in project root (tool-agnostic — works for Claude, Codex, OpenCode)
  - Invoked automatically by `/workflows:review` when no settings file exists
- **`learnings-researcher` in `/workflows:review`** — Always-run agent that searches `docs/solutions/` for past issues related to the PR
- **`schema-drift-detector` wired into `/workflows:review`** — Conditional agent for PRs with migrations

### Changed

- **`/workflows:review`** — Now reads review agents from `compound-engineering.local.md` settings file. Falls back to invoking setup skill if no file exists.
- **`/workflows:work`** — Review agents now configurable via settings file
- **`/release-docs` command** — Moved from plugin to local `.claude/commands/` (repo maintenance, not distributed)

### Removed

- **`/technical_review` command** — Superseded by configurable review agents

---

## [2.32.0] - 2026-02-11

### Added

- **Factory Droid target** — New converter target for [Factory Droid](https://docs.factory.ai). Install with `--to droid` to output agents, commands, and skills to `~/.factory/`. Includes tool name mapping (Claude → Factory), namespace prefix stripping, Task syntax conversion, and agent reference rewriting. 13 new tests (9 converter + 4 writer). ([#174](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin/pull/174))

---

## [2.31.1] - 2026-02-09

### Changed

- **`dspy-ruby` skill** — Complete rewrite to DSPy.rb v0.34.3 API: `.call()` / `result.field` patterns, `T::Enum` classes, `DSPy::Tools::Base` / `Toolset`. Added events system, lifecycle callbacks, fiber-local LM context, GEPA optimization, evaluation framework, typed context pattern, BAML/TOON schema formats, storage system, score reporting, RubyLLM adapter. 5 reference files (2 new: toolsets, observability), 3 asset templates rewritten.

## [2.31.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added

- **`document-review` skill** — Brainstorm and plan refinement through structured review ([@Trevin Chow](https://github.com/trevin))
- **`/sync` command** — Sync Claude Code personal config across machines ([@Terry Li](https://github.com/terryli))

### Changed

- **Context token optimization (79% reduction)** — Plugin was consuming 316% of the context description budget, causing Claude Code to silently exclude components. Now at 65% with room to grow:
  - All 29 agent descriptions trimmed from ~1,400 to ~180 chars avg (examples moved to agent body)
  - 18 manual commands marked `disable-model-invocation: true` (side-effect commands like `/lfg`, `/deploy-docs`, `/triage`, etc.)
  - 6 manual skills marked `disable-model-invocation: true` (`orchestrating-swarms`, `git-worktree`, `skill-creator`, `compound-docs`, `file-todos`, `resolve-pr-parallel`)
- **git-worktree**: Remove confirmation prompt for worktree creation ([@Sam Xie](https://github.com/samxie))
- **Prevent subagents from writing intermediary files** in compound workflow ([@Trevin Chow](https://github.com/trevin))

### Fixed

- Fix crash when hook entries have no matcher ([@Roberto Mello](https://github.com/robertomello))
- Fix git-worktree detection where `.git` is a file, not a directory ([@David Alley](https://github.com/davidalley))
- Backup existing config files before overwriting in sync ([@Zac Williams](https://github.com/zacwilliams))
- Note new repository URL ([@Aarni Koskela](https://github.com/aarnikoskela))
- Plugin component counts corrected: 29 agents, 24 commands, 18 skills

## [2.19.0] - 2025-12-31

### Added

- **`/deepen-plan` command** - Power enhancement for plans. Takes an existing plan and runs parallel research sub-agents for each major section to add:
  - Best practices and industry patterns
  - Performance optimizations
  - UI/UX improvements (if applicable)
  - Quality enhancements and edge cases
  - Real-world implementation examples

  The result is a deeply grounded, production-ready plan with concrete implementation details.

### Changed

- **`/workflows:plan` command** - Added `/deepen-plan` as option 2 in post-generation menu. Added note: if running with ultrathink enabled, automatically run deepen-plan for maximum depth.

## [2.18.0] - 2025-12-25

### Added

- **`agent-native-architecture` skill** - Added **Dynamic Capability Discovery** pattern and **Architecture Review Checklist**:

  **New Patterns in mcp-tool-design.md:**
  - **Dynamic Capability Discovery** - For external APIs (HealthKit, HomeKit, GraphQL), build a discovery tool (`list_*`) that returns available capabilities at runtime, plus a generic access tool that takes strings (not enums). The API validates, not your code. This means agents can use new API capabilities without code changes.
  - **CRUD Completeness** - Every entity the agent can create must also be readable, updatable, and deletable. Incomplete CRUD = broken action parity.

  **New in SKILL.md:**
  - **Architecture Review Checklist** - Pushes reviewer findings earlier into the design phase. Covers tool design (dynamic vs static, CRUD completeness), action parity (capability map, edit/delete), UI integration (agent → UI communication), and context injection.
  - **Option 11: API Integration** - New intake option for connecting to external APIs like HealthKit, HomeKit, GraphQL
  - **New anti-patterns:** Static Tool Mapping (building individual tools for each API endpoint), Incomplete CRUD (create-only tools)
  - **Tool Design Criteria** section added to success criteria checklist

  **New in shared-workspace-architecture.md:**
  - **iCloud File Storage for Multi-Device Sync** - Use iCloud Documents for your shared workspace to get free, automatic multi-device sync without building a sync layer. Includes implementation pattern, conflict handling, entitlements, and when NOT to use it.

### Philosophy

This update codifies a key insight for **agent-native apps**: when integrating with external APIs where the agent should have the same access as the user, use **Dynamic Capability Discovery** instead of static tool mapping. Instead of building `read_steps`, `read_heart_rate`, `read_sleep`... build `list_health_types` + `read_health_data(dataType: string)`. The agent discovers what's available, the API validates the type.

Note: This pattern is specifically for agent-native apps following the "whatever the user can do, the agent can do" philosophy. For constrained agents with intentionally limited capabilities, static tool mapping may be appropriate.

---

## [2.17.0] - 2025-12-25

### Enhanced

- **`agent-native-architecture` skill** - Major expansion based on real-world learnings from building the Every Reader iOS app. Added 5 new reference documents and expanded existing ones:

  **New References:**
  - **dynamic-context-injection.md** - How to inject runtime app state into agent system prompts. Covers context injection patterns, what context to inject (resources, activity, capabilities, vocabulary), implementation patterns for Swift/iOS and TypeScript, and context freshness.
  - **action-parity-discipline.md** - Workflow for ensuring agents can do everything users can do. Includes capability mapping templates, parity audit process, PR checklists, tool design for parity, and context parity guidelines.
  - **shared-workspace-architecture.md** - Patterns for agents and users working in the same data space. Covers directory structure, file tools, UI integration (file watching, shared stores), agent-user collaboration patterns, and security considerations.
  - **agent-native-testing.md** - Testing patterns for agent-native apps. Includes "Can Agent Do It?" tests, the Surprise Test, automated parity testing, integration testing, and CI/CD integration.
  - **mobile-patterns.md** - Mobile-specific patterns for iOS/Android. Covers background execution (checkpoint/resume), permission handling, cost-aware design (model tiers, token budgets, network awareness), offline handling, and battery awareness.

  **Updated References:**
  - **architecture-patterns.md** - Added 3 new patterns: Unified Agent Architecture (one orchestrator, many agent types), Agent-to-UI Communication (shared data store, file watching, event bus), and Model Tier Selection (fast/balanced/powerful).

  **Updated Skill Root:**
  - **SKILL.md** - Expanded intake menu (now 10 options including context injection, action parity, shared workspace, testing, mobile patterns). Added 5 new agent-native anti-patterns (Context Starvation, Orphan Features, Sandbox Isolation, Silent Actions, Capability Hiding). Expanded success criteria with agent-native and mobile-specific checklists.

- **`agent-native-reviewer` agent** - Significantly enhanced with comprehensive review process covering all new patterns. Now checks for action parity, context parity, shared workspace, tool design (primitives vs workflows), dynamic context injection, and mobile-specific concerns. Includes detailed anti-patterns, output format template, quick checks ("Write to Location" test, Surprise test), and mobile-specific verification.

### Philosophy

These updates operationalize a key insight from building agent-native mobile apps: **"The agent should be able to do anything the user can do, through tools that mirror UI capabilities, with full context about the app state."** The failure case that prompted these changes: an agent asked "what reading feed?" when a user said "write something in my reading feed"—because it had no `publish_to_feed` tool and no context about what "feed" meant.

## [2.16.0] - 2025-12-21

### Enhanced

- **`dhh-rails-style` skill** - Massively expanded reference documentation incorporating patterns from Marc Köhlbrugge's Unofficial 37signals Coding Style Guide:
  - **controllers.md** - Added authorization patterns, rate limiting, Sec-Fetch-Site CSRF protection, request context concerns
  - **models.md** - Added validation philosophy, let it crash philosophy (bang methods), default values with lambdas, Rails 7.1+ patterns (normalizes, delegated types, store accessor), concern guidelines with touch chains
  - **frontend.md** - Added Turbo morphing best practices, Turbo frames patterns, 6 new Stimulus controllers (auto-submit, dialog, local-time, etc.), Stimulus best practices, view helpers, caching with personalization, broadcasting patterns
  - **architecture.md** - Added path-based multi-tenancy, database patterns (UUIDs, state as records, hard deletes, counter caches), background job patterns (transaction safety, error handling, batch processing), email patterns, security patterns (XSS, SSRF, CSP), Active Storage patterns
  - **gems.md** - Added expanded what-they-avoid section (service objects, form objects, decorators, CSS preprocessors, React/Vue), testing philosophy with Minitest/fixtures patterns
