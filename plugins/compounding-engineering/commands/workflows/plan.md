# Create a plan for a new feature or bug fix

## Introduction

Transform feature descriptions, bug reports, or improvement ideas into well-structured markdown files issues that follow project conventions and best practices. This command provides flexible detail levels to match your needs.

## Feature Description

<feature_description> #$ARGUMENTS </feature_description>

## Main Tasks

### 1. Repository Research & Context Gathering

<thinking>
First, I need to understand the project's conventions and existing patterns, leveraging all available resources and use paralel subagents to do this.
</thinking>

Runn these three agents in paralel at the same time:

- Task repo-research-analyst(feature_description)
- Task best-practices-researcher(feature_description)
- Task framework-docs-researcher(feature_description)

**Reference Collection:**

- [ ] Document all research findings with specific file paths (e.g., `app/services/example_service.rb:42`)
- [ ] Include URLs to external documentation and best practices guides
- [ ] Create a reference list of similar issues or PRs (e.g., `#123`, `#456`)
- [ ] Note any team conventions discovered in `CLAUDE.md` or team documentation

### 2. Issue Planning & Structure

<thinking>
Think like a product manager - what would make this issue clear and actionable? Consider multiple perspectives
</thinking>

**Title & Categorization:**

- [ ] Draft clear, searchable issue title using conventional format (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`)
- [ ] Determine issue type: enhancement, bug, refactor

**Stakeholder Analysis:**

- [ ] Identify who will be affected by this issue (end users, developers, operations)
- [ ] Consider implementation complexity and required expertise

**Content Planning:**

- [ ] Choose appropriate detail level based on issue complexity and audience
- [ ] List all necessary sections for the chosen template
- [ ] Gather supporting materials (error logs, screenshots, design mockups)
- [ ] Prepare code examples or reproduction steps if applicable, name the mock filenames in the lists

### 3. SpecFlow Analysis

After planning the issue structure, run SpecFlow Analyzer to validate and refine the feature specification:

- Task spec-flow-analyzer(feature_description, research_findings)

**SpecFlow Analyzer Output:**

- [ ] Review SpecFlow analysis results
- [ ] Incorporate any identified gaps or edge cases into the issue
- [ ] Update acceptance criteria based on SpecFlow findings

### 4. Choose Implementation Detail Level

Select how comprehensive you want the issue to be, simpler is mostly better.

#### 📄 MINIMAL (Quick Issue)

**Best for:** Simple bugs, small improvements, clear features

**Includes:**

- Problem statement or feature description

- Essential context only

**Structure:**

````markdown

## MVP

### test.rb

```ruby

  def initialize
    @name = "test"
  end
end
```

### 5. Issue Creation & Formatting

<thinking>
Apply best practices for clarity and actionability, making the issue easy to scan and understand
</thinking>

**Content Formatting:**

- [ ] Use clear, descriptive headings with proper hierarchy (##, ###)
- [ ] Include code examples in triple backticks with language syntax highlighting
- [ ] Add screenshots/mockups if UI-related (drag & drop or use image hosting)
- [ ] Use task lists (- [ ]) for trackable items that can be checked off
- [ ] Add collapsible sections for lengthy logs or optional details using `<details>` tags
- [ ] Apply appropriate emoji for visual scanning (🐛 bug, ✨ feature, 📚 docs, ♻️ refactor)

**Cross-Referencing:**

- [ ] Link to related issues/PRs using #number format
- [ ] Reference specific commits with SHA hashes when relevant
- [ ] Link to code using GitHub's permalink feature (press 'y' for permanent link)
- [ ] Mention relevant team members with @username if needed
- [ ] Add links to external resources with descriptive text

**Code & Examples:**

```markdown
# Good example with syntax highlighting and line references
```

```ruby
# app/services/user_service.rb:42
def process_user(user)

# Implementation here

end
```
````

# Collapsible error logs

<details>
<summary>Full error stacktrace</summary>

`Error details here...`

</details>

**AI-Era Considerations:**

- [ ] Account for accelerated development with AI pair programming
- [ ] Include prompts or instructions that worked well during research
- [ ] Note which AI tools were used for initial exploration (Claude, Copilot, etc.)
- [ ] Emphasize comprehensive testing given rapid implementation
- [ ] Document any AI-generated code that needs human review

### 6. Final Review & Submission

**Pre-submission Checklist:**

- [ ] Title is searchable and descriptive
- [ ] Labels accurately categorize the issue
- [ ] All template sections are complete
- [ ] Links and references are working
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are measurable
- [ ] Add names of files in pseudo code examples and todo lists
- [ ] Add an ERD mermaid diagram if applicable for new model changes

## Output Format

write to plans/<issue_title>.md

Now call the /plan_review command with the plan file as the argument. Make sure to include the plan file in the command.

## Thinking Approaches

- **Analytical:** Break down complex features into manageable components
- **User-Centric:** Consider end-user impact and experience
- **Technical:** Evaluate implementation complexity and architecture fit
- **Strategic:** Align with project goals and roadmap

After you get the review back, ask the user questions about the current state of the plan and what the reviewers came back with. Make sure to underatand if this plan is too big or thinks are missing. Are there any other considerations that should be included? Keep askign questions until the user is happy with the plan. THEN update the plan file with the user's feedback.

Optional you can ask to create a Github issue from the plan file.

NEVER CODE! Just research and write the plan.
